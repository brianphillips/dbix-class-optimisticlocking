There are a few things that I'm not thrilled about in this module as it
currently stands:
* DBIx::Class::Row doesn't provide good hooks into overriding the
  condition used when updating a row. As a workaround, this module
  accesses and modifies the $self->{_orig_ident} at the appropriate
  point in the code.  It'd be nice if this was broken out into a separate
  method within DBIx::Class::Row.
* DBIx::Class::Row::update doesn't allow a component to customize
  the error message that is thrown when an update fails.  This results in
  a confusing error being returned to the user that the row for update
  can't be found.  This module could do some string matching on the
  exception thrown and throw a different exception but I'm leaving it
  as is for the moment in hopes that this can be addressed in a better
  way.
